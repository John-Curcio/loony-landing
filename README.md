# loony-landing
A small step for man.

Loony Landing is a spaceflight simulator and a playground to experiment with realistic physics phenomena. 
It is written in Python 3 and depends on numpy and pygame. 


flyer2D.py handles physical and numerical calculations. It may be said to be the game's physics engine.
lunarLanding.py is the home of the event loop and where things are displayed to the screen.
vectorAlgebra.py handles some modest vector algebra when a built-in function in numpy is not to be found.
