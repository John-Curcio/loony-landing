# loony-landing
A small step for man.

Loony Landing is a spaceflight simulator and a playground to experiment with realistic physics phenomena. 
It is written in Python 3 and depends on numpy and pygame. 

flyer2D.py is a module to handle physical and numerical calculations.
lunarLanding.py is the home of the event loop and where things are displayed to the screen.
vectorAlgebra.py is an extra module that handles some modest vector algebra when a built-in function in numpy is not to be found.
